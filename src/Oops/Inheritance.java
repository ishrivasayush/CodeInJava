# Inheritance

- if properties from parent class coming to child class then it is called as inheritance.

### Why ?
reusability

- we use extends keyword in this.

## Types Of Inheritance
- Single
- multilevel
- multiple
    - super() if the multiple inheritance is present in java than constructor of a child class creates the problem which constructor is to be called.
    - if both super class have same method than which method is to be inherited in sub class that's create the problem.
- hybrid
- hierarchical

- private members doesn't take participate in Inheritance.
